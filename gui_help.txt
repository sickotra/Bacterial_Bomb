Bacterial Bomb Model - HELP
--------------------------------


The model can be run with default parameters listed on the screen. 
To use these parameters, click on the "Run with default parameters" button.

The model can also run with the number of particles chosen using the slider.
To choose the total particles used in the model, set the slider to the desired number. 
Click on the "Set number of particles" button and this will run the model with the chosen number.

The outputs displayed in both cases will be two figures.
The first will be a figure showing the spread of the bacterial particles in the town,
with the bomb location marked by a red diamond. 
The second will be a density map of the particles.

A text file of the particle end coordinates and a text file representing the density map will
also be saved to the working directory.
