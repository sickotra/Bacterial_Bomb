# Bacterial Bomb Future Development 
Modelling spread of bacteria 

* Slider and button has been created and added to the GUI to control the number of particles. 
A method still needs to be created for the button command. The method should take the slider/scale value and set the `num_of_particles` variable to this value. Some code has been written for this but is not functional yet.

* A desktop icon to run the GUI could be created so that running to program is made easier for the user

* A 3D animation to show the particles being spread could be created.

* Make the console output display on the GUI
